**********************************************************************
Format
**********************************************************************
#. Reminder: Do NOT act smart.
#. Start with examples:

	- Start with one small example. Specify input and output.
	- Confirm if the understanding of the problem is correct.
	- Confirm about the input range.
	- Identify corner cases.
	- Usually 3 examples are good - one for algorithm understanding, and 2 for corner cases.

#. Note down obversations and approach:

	- Lay out the algorithm in words.
	- Mention time complexity in the notes.

#. Code:

	- Keep comments.

#. Test:

	- Dry run on examples and debug.
**********************************************************************
Checklist
**********************************************************************
#. Evaluate trade-offs.  
#. Ask clarifying questions before coding - range, sorted, streaming.
#. Write the core logic.  
#. Check boundary conditions.  
#. Create test cases before dry running.  
#. Ensure a smooth implementation.  
#. Solve 3-4 follow-ups.  
#. Optimize time and space complexity.  
#. Use clear variable names and correct syntax.  
#. Wrap up efficiently.

**********************************************************************
During the interview: Remember
**********************************************************************
#. Take your time - longer than you think you should.

	Spend more time collaborating with the interviewer - planning, writing comments, discussing approach, brainstorming

#. Collect observations about the problem.

	Helps in understanding the nature of the problem. Identify base cases, edge cases.

#. Sample inputs and outputs

	Should be small enough - it should be possible to manually convert the input to output.

#. Write pseudocode

	#. Think out loud in comments and in pseudocode.
	#. During actual coding, swap comments with actual code.
	#. If the approach itself is not clear, it's okay to say: I am not sure about this. Need a min to think about it.

#. Approaching a solution
	
	#. Get a brute force to work - verifies that we're solving the right problem.
	
		If an optimization on this isn't immediately clear, ask if it's okay to code this approach.

	#. Think and talk about runtime and memory constantly
	
		Interviewer needs to know that you're thinking about efficiency. Might give points.

	#. Whenever stuck, think about this:
	
		#. Can we map it to something that we know how to solve?
		#. What exactly is required?
		#. What's the easiest way to get us there?
		#. What's the bottleneck? What do we need to keep track of?
		#. What other ways we can get there?

	#. Getting to an optimal solution
	
		#. One way to think about this - analyze current runtime. Check for data structures/approaches which are next better. Can any of them work?
		#. Think if stuck because the input isn't structured well for the task at hand.

			#. Can I preprocess the input so that the task gets done faster?
			#. We can either modify the algorithm to fit the data structure or modify the data structure to fit the algorithm. Latter is better.

#. Writing code

	#. Fill out the outline first - fill in details later
	#. Follow single responsibility principles (SRP)
	#. Keep in mind of variable naming and readability.

**********************************************************************
Prior to the interview: Remember
**********************************************************************
#. Take care of yourself

	#. Maintain motivation, confidence and mental health
	#. Ensure to have other things going in life - getting this job is good but isn't the end goal
#. What kind of problems to solve?

	#. 2-3 days leading up to the interview

		#. Don't try to solve any new ridiculuously hard problem
		#. Don't want to walk into the interview on a losing streak
		#. Understand what makes you confident. Big picture? Grasp on the bag of tricks? Having the process reharsed and clear inside your head.
	#. 24 hours leading up to the interview

		#. Avoid cramming. Do things that makes you feel good

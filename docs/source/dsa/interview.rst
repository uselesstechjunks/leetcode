**********************************************************************
Checklist
**********************************************************************
#. Evaluate trade-offs.  
#. Ask clarifying questions before coding.  
#. Write the core logic.  
#. Check boundary conditions.  
#. Create test cases before dry running.  
#. Ensure a smooth implementation.  
#. Solve 3-4 follow-ups.  
#. Optimize time and space complexity.  
#. Use clear variable names and correct syntax.  
#. Wrap up efficiently.

**********************************************************************
During the interview: Remember
**********************************************************************
#. Take your time - way longer than you think you need to.

	Spend more time collaborating with the interviewer - planning, writing comments, discussing approach, brainstorming

#. Collect observations about the problem.

	Helps in understanding the nature of the problem. Identify base cases, edge cases.

#. Sample inputs and outputs

	Should be small enough - it should be possible to manually convert the input to output.

#. Write pseudocode

	- Think out loud in comments and in pseudocode.
	- During actual coding, swap all comments with actual code.
	- If the approach itself is not clear, it's totally okay to say: I am not sure about this. Need a min to think about it.

#. Approaching a solution
	
	#. Get a brute force to work - verifies that we're solving the right problem and at least one approach works.
	
		If an optimization on this isn't immediately clear, ask if it's okay to code this approach.

	#. Think and talk about runtime and memory constantly
	
		Interviewer needs to know that you're thinking about efficiency. Might give points even if we don't get to an optimal one.

	#. Think constantly
	
		- What do we actually want?
		- Is there anything that needs to happen for us to get there?
		- What are all the things that could affect it?
		- What are all the possible cases of things that could happen?

	#. Getting to an optimal solution
	
		- One way to think about this - analyze current runtime. Check for data structures/approaches which are next better. Can any of them work?
		- Think if stuck because the input isn't structured well for the task at hand?

			- How can I preprocess the input so that the task gets done faster?
			- We can either modify the algorithm to fit the data structure or modify the data structure to fit the algorithm. Latter is better.

#. Writing code

	#. Fill out the outline first - fill in details later
	#. Follow single responsibility principles (SRP)
	#. Keep in mind of variable naming and readability.

**********************************************************************
Prior to the interview: Remember
**********************************************************************
#. Take care of yourself

	#. Maintain motivation, confidence and mental health
	#. Ensure to have other things going in life - not getting this job is good but isn't the end goal
#. What kind of problems to solve?

	#. 2-3 days leading up to the interview

		#. Don't try to solve any new ridiculuously hard problem
		#. Don't want to walk into the interview on a losing streak
		#. Understand what makes you confident. Big picture? Grasp on the bag of tricks? Having the process reharsed and clear inside your head.
	#. 24 hours leading up to the interview

		#. Avoid cramming

- [Hard] `Longest Equal Subarray After <=k Replacements <https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/description/>`_

	- Let's consider a window from the start which contains some character n times (max_freq). 
	- For longest valid window, at most k other characters can be added. 
	- Once such a condition is breached, we can MOVE THE WINDOW BY 1 TO THE RIGHT and keep track of frequencies. 
	- IT'S NOT NECESSARY UPDATE n TO MATCH THE MAX FREQUENCY OF THE CURRENT WINDOW. 
	- The ans would only change if another window is found with some character with > n frequency. 
	- Since the increment happens by 1, the length comparison `r-l+1 - max_freq == k+1: works once a larger frequency is found even though left has moved.
	- Decreasing count from the left ensures that we won't be increasing max_freq incorrectly.

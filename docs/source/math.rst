  :alt: How I see Math

Mathematics is a formal description of some of the concepts we find useful in the real world, with the ability to transcend beyond anything known in the real world. The nature of Mathematics is such that once described in formal language, the treatment of mathematical principles on mathematical objects is completely divorced from the practicality that gave rise to it. While it often originates while trying to solve *specific* problems, where mathematics truly succeeds is when we find *generic* patterns that are prevalent in many problems, related or unrelated. 

To preserve this spirit of mathematics, I will try to capture my understanding of this subject in the following fashion:

- Core Concepts: These are meant to capture the underlying theme of certain recurring concepts in mathematics. For example, the concept of a basis, which is found in the digital representation of numbers, vector spaces, topological spaces, function spaces, etc.
- Techniques: The core concepts, when described for a particular type of mathematical object, often require specific techniques to realise. For example, basis in vector spaces are realised via the technique of Eigendecomposition.
- Applied: The techniques that we use to capture a core concept are often useful for some other *mathematical* problem. For example, we can use Eigendecomposition to compute matrix power or matrix exponentiation.
- Engineering: This refers to the application to *real-world* problems. For example, we can compute PageRank using matrix exponentiation.

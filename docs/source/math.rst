  :alt: How I see Math

Mathematics is a formal description for some of the concepts we find useful. It often originates while trying to solve some *specific* problems. However, where mathematics truely succeeds is when we find some *generic* patterns that are prevelant in many such related or unrelated problems. Once described in formal language, the treatment of mathematical principles on mathematical objects is completely divolved of the practicality that gave rise to it. To preserve this spirit of mathematics, I will try to capture my understanding of this subject in the following fashion:
- Core Concepts: These are meant to capture the underlying theme of certain concepts in mathematics that appears in many different areas. For example, the concept basis.
- Techniques: The core concepts, when described for a particular type of mathematical object, often requires a specific technique to realise. For example, basis in vector spaces are realised via the technique of Eigendecomposition.
- Applied: The techniques that we use to capture a core-concept is often useful to some other mathematical problem. For example, we can use Eigendecomposition to compute matrix power or matrix exponentiation.
- Engineering: This refers to application to real-world problems (as opposed to *mathematical* problems in the previous segment). For example, we can compute PageRank using matrix exponentiation.

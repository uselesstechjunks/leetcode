Science of Sleeping
###########################################

Sleep resets the ability to be focused, alert and emotionally stable in the wakeful period.  

There are 2 forces that determines sleep. Chemical forces which are adenosine, cortisol, epinephrine and adrenaline and Melatonin. And the Circadian Force which is the clock that exists in our brains that determines when we want to be sleepy or awake. Light exposure is the key driving force to setting our circadian rhythm & driving the right chemical/hormonal forces at the right times of day. 

Best Waking Practices 
------------------------------------

#. Get outside upon waking (ideally within 1-2 hours of sunrise) and get light exposure to the eyes & body. (Don’t look at light if it hurts your eyes). Early in the day, your retina is not sensitive which will need a lot of photons coming from sunlight to set clock mechanisms.  
#. Sunrise light intensity & color temperature (from sun being low in the sky) is ideal to set our circadian and hormonal rhythm.   
#. Getting outside is ideal because the intensity of outdoor light is so much greater than indoor or screen light. (Outdoors Sunny day: 100,000 lux, Outdoors Cloudy Day: 10,000-50,000 lux and Inside Bright lights: 500 – 1,000 lux)   
#. Time needed in outdoor morning light to set our body clock (Outside Sunny Day: 30-60 seconds and Outside Cloudy Day: ~5 minutes) 
#. Important to be outside, viewing sunlight through a window will take 50x as long for your brain to get the necessary light information.  
#. We want blue light during day, don’t wear blue light blocking glasses during the day.  

Best Evening Practices 
------------------------------------

#. Get outside to see the sunset. Sun is at low solar angle and close to the horizon, drives melanopsin which signals the circadian clock that it’s the end of the day  
#. Use night mode screen on your device screens (my note: F.lux program for computer)  
#. Dim lights, using warmer color temperature. (my note: Philips hue)  
#. Candles / Fireplace wont causing wakefulness signals (Don’t burn down house)  
#. The cells in our eyes that signals the central clock resides mostly in the bottom half of our retina which means it’s viewing our upper visual field. To avoid improper activation of neurons, place light low in your physical environment, on desktops or floor. 
#. It is absolutely crucial to avoid light exposure between 11pm and 4am. It will disrupt many important physiological processes that help us rest and repair.

Provide consistent powerful light anchors during the day and avoiding light at night, you get a tremendous number of positive effects on your wellbeing.   

Control your sleep environment 
------------------------------------

#. Get the right light exposure at the right times  
#. Have dim, low lights at night 
#. Get the proper sleep surface & pillow for spine alignment (my note: organic natural material)  
#. Set the right sleep temperature (my note: ~65F (18.3 degrees Celsius))
#. Set your exercise timing to a regular period throughout the week, ideally in the morning.  

Non-Sleep Deep Rest are practices that activate cells in your body that promotes the parasympathetic or calming system. 

#. Yoga Nidra/Yoga Sleep (Dr. Huberman's favorite) 
#. Meditation 
#. Hypnosis 

Recommended Sleep Drugs & Supplements 
--------------------------------------------

#. Magnesium - Huberman takes 300-400 mg, 30 mins before sleep (Consult doctor about appropriate dosing for you.) 
#. Theanine - Take 100–200mg of theanine 30–60 minutes before bed 
#. Apigenin (Can lower estrogen, women use caution) - Taking 50mg of apigenin can support the creation of sleepiness and you help fall asleep faster.

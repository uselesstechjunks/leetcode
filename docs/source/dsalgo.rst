	#. Find the shortest path where one edge’s weight can be reduced by a discount or percentage.
	#. Edge weights vary based on the time of traversal (e.g., traffic at different times).
	#. Find the shortest path that visits all nodes at least once.
	#. Edge weights change dynamically during traversal (e.g., based on usage or traffic updates).	
	#. Compute the shortest path between multiple source-destination pairs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#. Verifying and Improving Connectivity

	The police department in the city has converted every street into a one-way road. The mayor claims that it is possible to legally drive from any intersection in the city to any other intersection.
	
		* Verify Strong Connectivity: Design an algorithm to determine whether the city is strongly connected. If it is not, refute the mayor’s claim.  
		* Good Intersections: Call an intersection :math:`x` *good* if, for any intersection :math:`y` that one can legally reach from :math:`x`, it is possible to legally drive from :math:`y` back to :math:`x`. The mayor further claims that over 95% of the intersections in Sham-Poobanana are good. Devise an algorithm to verify or refute this claim.  
		* Reachability Pairs: Count the number of pairs of intersections :math:`(A, B)` where :math:`A` can reach :math:`B`, but :math:`B` cannot reach :math:`A`.  
		* Maximum Reachability Intersection: Find the intersection with the highest reachability, defined as the number of intersections reachable from it.  
		* Restoring Strong Connectivity: Determine the minimum number of streets that need to be converted back to two-way roads to make the city strongly connected.  
		* Signage Changes with Minimum Hires: People can be hired at intersections to convert roads back to two-way streets. They must obey traffic laws while doing so (i.e., they can only travel back on a street after making it two-way). Devise an efficient algorithm to minimize the number of people hired and provide an order of operations for each person to change signage.

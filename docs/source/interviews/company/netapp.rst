Data Pipeline:
	.. note::
		Problem: Write a Python script that reads a large CSV file in chunks, filters rows based on a condition (e.g., file size > 100 MB), and writes the filtered rows to a new file.

Model Evaluation:
	.. note::
		Problem: Write a function to compute precision, recall, and F1-score given true and predicted labels.

Custom Metric Implementation:
	.. note::
		Problem: Implement a function to compute the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) for given true and predicted probabilities.
	
Feature Engineering:
	.. note::
		Problem: Given a dataset of file uploads with columns file_id, file_size, and upload_date, create a new feature representing the file size as a percentage of the average file size for its upload date.
	
Time Series Analysis:
	.. note::
		Problem: Write a function to detect outliers in a time series data based on a rolling window standard deviation.
	
Clustering:
	.. note::
		Problem: Implement k-means clustering from scratch in Python and cluster a given dataset into 3 groups.

Dimensionality Reduction:
	.. note::
		Problem: Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions of a high-dimensional dataset and retain 95% of the variance.
	
Decision Trees:
	.. note::
		Problem: Implement a simple decision tree classifier to predict whether a file is likely to be accessed frequently based on features like file size, user ID, and file type.

Natural Language Processing:
	.. note::
		Problem: Implement a simple sentiment analysis model using Naive Bayes to classify user reviews as positive or negative.
	
API Data Fetching:
	.. note::
		Problem: Fetch data from a public API (e.g., GitHub repositories), clean it, and find the top 5 repositories with the most stars.

Optimization Problem:
	.. note::
		Problem: Given a list of file sizes and a storage limit, write a function to find the maximum number of files that can fit within the storage limit.
	
SQL-Based Questions
========================================================================================
Basic Query:

Join and Aggregation:
	.. note::
		Problem: Given two tables, users (with user_id, name) and files (with file_id, user_id, file_size), find the total file size uploaded by each user.

Window Functions:
	.. note::

Data Cleaning:
	.. note::
		Problem: Find and delete duplicate rows in a table files based on the columns file_name and upload_date.

Complex Joins:
	.. note::
		Problem: Given three tables—users, files, and tags—find all files tagged as "important" by users who have uploaded more than 100 files.

Dynamic Queries:
	.. note::
		Problem: Create a query to find the average file size for each file_type, and return only those averages above a threshold (e.g., 100 MB).

Recursive Queries:

Pivot Table:
	.. note::
		Problem: Write a query to convert rows of file types and their counts into a column format for better visualization.

Multi-Table Analysis:
	.. note::
		Problem: Given two tables—files (with file_id, user_id, file_size) and file_tags (with file_id, tag)—write a query to find the top 3 tags associated with the largest files.

Temporal Analysis:
	.. note::
		Problem: Write a query to find the average file size uploaded per day over the past 30 days.

Data Validation:
	.. note::
		Problem: Write a query to identify rows in a table files where upload_date is later than the modification_date.

Case Statement:
	.. note::
		Problem: Write a query to classify files into size categories ("Small", "Medium", "Large") based on predefined thresholds.

Round 2: ML Breadth - Application to Real-World Problem, First-Principle Thinking  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This round will likely test your ability to break down a real-world problem, formulate it in ML terms, and develop a principled solution. Expect broad questions that assess your fundamental ML knowledge and problem-solving approach.  

Potential Questions:  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

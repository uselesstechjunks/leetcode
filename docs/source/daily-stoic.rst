Key Takeaways: `The Obstacle is the Way <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18668059-the-obstacle-is-the-way>`_
**************************************************

There’s a lot of stuff out there that tries to teach us lessons from successful people. My primary issue with them has always been that most of it seems to be suffering from `survivor's bias <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias>`_. Which is why I was quite surprised to see that this book in particular actually works for me. I think I can narrow down the reason to two. First, it doesn’t try to focus on a select few successful people and then start glorifying almost every aspect of their lives. Rather, this book seems to already know the lessons, and it cherry-picks stories of successful people to drive the point home. Sure, there’s some `selection bias <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias>`_, but, to me, it's the lesser of the two evils. Second, thanks to `Veritasium <https://www.veritasium.com/videos/2020/8/28/is-success-luck-or-hard-work>`_, I subscribe to the thought that even though the role of luck in success is undeniable, focusing on the buttons that are in our hands might have a second-order impact on success - by keeping ourselves motivated through the illusion of being in charge. I don’t particularly mind manipulating myself this way. Why? Because the way I perceive the universe is anyway just a construct inside my brain. Think of the narrow band of signals (visual/auditory) we sample from the “true” universe. Think of how much else we either just outright reject or extrapolate. Might as well game my perceptions to my benefit.

These are the key points from the book that I want to remember.

Perception
--------------------------------------------------

* *Observation* (objective) and *perception* (subjective) are two different things. Faced with an obstacle, focusing on the objective view helps.
* The power of demystifying things by explaining them away with rationality is criminally underrated.
* Our mind is capable of doing more than what we have evolved for. Take reading/writing for instance.
* We have to calm ourselves when faced with a challenge. Our primal instincts usually overreact as they evolved in much harsher conditions than the one we live in today. "Trust your instinct" might no longer be the right thing to do. Observing, on the other hand, that all your senses are going into overdrive and it's a perfectly natural way to respond based on how our ancestors evolved - might just be the one we need to bring some calmness into the equation.
* Beneath every hopeless situation there's *always* something positive to be found - at least a chance to learn, to grow, to seize, to rise up to the challenge.
* Obstacles can be partitioned into two disjoint sets - ones which we can act upon and ones we can't do anything about. It's *always* our choice on which we focus.

Action
--------------------------------------------------

* We can get out of `analysis-paralysis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis>`_ by just focusing on getting our *foot-in-the-door*. When starting something new, starting at the bottom isn't all that unnatural.
* We can think of ourselves like Silicon Valley start-ups - always WIP with room to grow and course-correct. With this mindset, we can get the MVP of ourselves out, fail fast, break things, learn from feedbacks and iterate. This insight encompasses `Show your work <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18290401-show-your-work>`_ and could be treated as the underlying theme of all growth-mindset books, e.g., `Mindsets <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40745.Mindset>`_.
* *Trust the process*. It's super important to not get distracted by shinny things! Once the path is chalked out, focusing on just the steps helps. We can even automate this by forming habits (see `Atomic Habits <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits>`_).
* If we see ourselves as someone who *always* does the job right - the rest of the world might do so as well.
* Being a by-the-book perfectionist might lead to gatekeeping. For most things in life, what works in practice always triumphs over what looked best on paper.
* There is no shame in taking the less glorious route to success.

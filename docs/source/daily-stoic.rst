Key Takeaways: The Obstacle is the Way
**************************************************

* *Observation* (objective) and *perception* (subjective) are two different things. Faced with an obstacle, focusing on the objective view helps.
* The power of demystifying things by explaining them away with rationality is criminally underrated.
* Our mind is capable of doing more than what we have evolved for. Take reading/writing for instance.
* We gotta calm ourselves when faced with a challenge. Our primal instincts usually overreact as they evolved in much harsher conditions than the one we live in today. "Trust your instinct" might no longer be the right thing to do. Observing, on the other hand, that all your senses are going into overdrive and it's a perfectly natural way to respond based on how our ancestors evolved - might just be the one we need to bring some calmness into the equation.
* Beneath every hopeless situation there's *always* something positive to be found - at least a chance to learn, to grow, to seize, to rise up to the challenge.
* Obstacles can be partitioned into two disjoint sets - ones which we can act upon and ones we can't do anything about. It's *always* our choice on which we focus.

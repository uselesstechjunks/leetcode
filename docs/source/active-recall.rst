Active-Recall and Spaced-Repetition

Summary from `this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--Hu2w0s72Y>`_ by Justin Sung.

- Studying is not the same as learning

- Studying is physical while learning is a cognitive process

- Studying techniques that produce low learning are time consuming

- Different techniques invoke different levels of learning

- Memory going into long-term memory is called encoding

- Level of encoding determines a significant amount of retention

- Retrieving memory from long-term to working memory in order to use it for applications is called retrieval

- Information that is in working memory instead of long term is forgotten very quickly

- Active recall and spaced repetition work through adjusting the forgetting curve only through repetition

- This is only working on retrieval aspect of memory only

- This doesn't help with encoding

- Encoding would reduce the knowledge decay of the forgetting curve to reduce the number of repetitive revisions and relearning sessions needed, therefore saving lots of time

- Proper encoding also makes learning more enjoyable and engaging

- Techniques that cause poor encoding and use low cognitive load are called passive techniques

- A sign of passive learning is sleepiness

- Techniques that cause high learning through appropriate cognitive load are called active learning techniques. There are many.

- Low retention studying due to poor encoding is unsustainable to fix with repetition based techniques

- Encoding involves cognitive load

- Cognitive load feels uncomfortable and confusing

- This is partially why so few students use encoding techniques

- Another reason retrieval techniques like active recall and spaced repetition are so common is due to the Dunning Kruger effect where low knowledge causes high confidence

- This combines with success bias where you don't hear about the failure stories

- This then combines with availability bias where we define legitimacy by how common we are exposed to it

- This creates a spiral of unknowledgeable people creating videos about common techniques that are not as effective as they claim, making it more available, increasing its perceived legitimacy

- Considering that encoding is naturally difficult, this makes encoding techniques very uncommonly talked about

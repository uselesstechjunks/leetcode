"""
Find Strongly Connected Components in a Directed Graph

Implement a function to find all SCCs in a directed graph using Kosarajuâ€™s Algorithm. Your function should take as input the number of nodes and a list of directed edges and output the SCCs as a list of lists, where each list contains the nodes in one SCC.

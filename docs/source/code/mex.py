	The goal is to find maximum possible MEX, therefore we should

	the idea is to use modular arithmatic.

	If we add value to any number x multiple times, we can transform
	it to the range [0, value-1]. We can check x % value to find this number.

	The problem then is to find MEX in [0, value-1] range.

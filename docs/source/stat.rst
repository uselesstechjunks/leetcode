Statistical Inference
******************************

We have a sample of size :math:`n` from an unknown distribution :math:`F_X`.

.. math::
    \mathbf{X}_1,\cdots\mathbf{X}_n \sim F_X

The fundamental task for statistical inference is then to infer :math:`F_X` or some function of :math:`F_X` (also known as statistical functionals, such as :math:`\mathbb{E}_X` or :math:`\text{Var}(X)`).

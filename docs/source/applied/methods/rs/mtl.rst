- General Recommender Systems
	- Use Case: Improving personalization by modeling multiple user behaviors.
	- Architecture: Shared-bottom, MMoE, PLE
	- Reference: Kumar, "`An Introduction to Multi-Task Learning based Recommender Systems <https://blog.reachsumit.com/posts/2024/01/multi-task-learning-recsys/>`_"
- Video Recommendation (e.g., YouTube)
	- Use Case: Predicting multiple user engagement metrics like watch time, likes, and shares.
	- Architecture: MMoE (Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts)
	- Reference: Zhao et al., "`Recommending What Video to Watch Next: A Multitask Ranking System <https://daiwk.github.io/assets/youtube-multitask.pdf>`_"
- E-commerce
	- Use Case: Joint modeling of click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (CVR), and gross merchandise value (GMV).
	- Architecture: DTN (Deep Multiple Task-specific Feature Interactions Network)
	- Reference: Bi et al., "`DTN: Deep Multiple Task-specific Feature Interactions Network for Multi-Task Recommendation <https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11611>`_"
- Short Video Platforms
	- Use Case: Enhancing recommendations by modeling dynamic user behaviors.
	- Architecture: User Behavior-Aware Multi-Task Learning Model (UBA-SVR)
	- Reference: "A user behavior-aware multi-task learning model for enhanced short video recommendation"
- Advertising
	- Use Case: Modeling sequential user actions such as impression → click → application → approval → activation.
	- Architecture: AITM (Adaptive Information Transfer Multi-task Learning)
	- Reference: "`Modeling the Sequential Dependence among Audience Multi-step Conversions with Multi-task Learning <https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08489>`_"
- Multi-Domain Recommendation
	- Use Case: Handling recommendations across multiple domains and tasks simultaneously.
	- Architecture: M3oE (Multi-Domain Multi-Task Mixture-of-Experts)
	- Reference: Zhang et al., "`M3oE: Multi-Domain Multi-Task Mixture-of-Experts Recommendation Framework <https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18465>`_"
